## Book Friends 

For a test account you can take test@test as email and test as password but you can also create your own account.

The website let users to create a secure account and search books into the Google books API to add it in their own book lists. There is a possibility to let reviews on each books. The user can also follow others users and see their book lists and last reviews.

It's also responsive for mobile users.

The front end is deploy on netlify and the back end on heroku.

## What techs I used 

- React and Redux for the front end
- Node Js and Express for the backend
- PostgreSQL and Redis as databases
- Docker and docker-compose for running the node js, postgres and redis container together
- JWT as token for securing route and let the user connect on the website
- Use Google Book Api
